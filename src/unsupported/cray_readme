	pbs_output.py

This script is not intended to be run by users or Administrators.
It is run by the Cray RUR system as an "output plugin" that will
write data specific to a PBS job to a well known path that PBS hooks
can access:

PBS_HOME/spool/<jobid>.rur

The format of the file will be:

pluginName : apid : pluginOutput

See the Cray document: "Managing System Software for the CrayÂ®
Linux Environment" section 12.7 "RUR Plugins" for more
information on the RUR plugin interface.
